The WX protocol (working title)


The goal here is to provide applications with mechanisms to do useful (and not so useful) stuff.
Inspired by the stuff X11 already does with programs like xdotool, redshift, OBS, and such.


This is a draft/prototype. I don't expect anyone to take it too seriously.
Feel free to contribute by opening a bug report or something.
I am making (and typing) this up as i go along, butt there has been some thought put into it beforehand.


I wrote this in maybe an hour.
Still a lot to be added. Something "Extended Window Manager Hints"-like *should* be the first to be copied, though, as they are really useful. Followed by layering (window over/uder windows), and ... There's so much missing, of stuff we don't even notice. Notice a tray like tint2 has a list of windows ? per desktop ? AFAIK there is no such thing in wayland-land. But hey, it is not that complicated.
