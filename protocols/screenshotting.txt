Screenshotting


1 Overview and rationale

1.1 Overview

Asks the wayland server to send a screenshot of a specified screen to this client.

1.2 Rationale

Screenshots are popular.


2 Protocol

2.1 Request

2.1.1 Type

WXT_REQUEST_SCREENSHOT

2.1.2 Data

[uint8 screen_number; uint8 format]

screen_number:
The ID of the screen to be shot.

format:
Requested image format.
WX_PIX_RGB8
WX_PIX_RGBA8
WX_PIX_GRAY8


2.3 Reply

[uint8 flag; uint8 pad; uint16 pad; uint32 len; data..]

flag:
WX_NOT_SUPPORTED = requested action is not supported
WX_OK            = request granted
WX_NOPERMISSION  = the client does not have permission to grab this screenshot
WXS_EFORMAT      = specified format is not supported by the server
WXS_ESCREEN      = requested screen can not be screenshot

len:
Total length of data. In bytes.

data:
The screenshot in raw format.


3 Design decisions and alternatives

The weird padding to align to 32 bytes is so that the client can potentially process the data more efficiently (for SIMD, basically, although aligning to 16 should be enough).
TODO:
Apropriate formats from GIMP (or something) instead of inventing our own.
Chop the picture into chunks as to not clog the connection ?
Pre-specified length chunks ?
